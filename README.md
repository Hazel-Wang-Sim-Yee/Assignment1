Tatsuya Kitani EN Website
This project is to create an english website for a japanese singer without losing out on most of the experience of looking through his actual website.

Design Process

As an English only user, I want to be able to easily use the website without having a need to translate anything myself, so that i can enjoy more content of the singer i like. This is done by translating all the text from the japanese website into english so that none of the information is loss while still being readable to english users. (However, google translate is used for the translation so some sentences may be innaccuarate to the actual site.)

As a less tech savvy user, I want to navigate a site without the need to open more new tabs, so that i can have a easier navigational experience. This is done by having most information on the main site while having some other pages that are to expand on the more specific pieces of information

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features:
Mostly flexible website - allows users to enjoy the website as much as possible even on different devices.
navigational bar - allows users to navigate to any part of the home screen where ever they are on the whole site.
toggle between news and live information - allows users to switch between news and live updates without the need to have them navigating to another area of the website
linking to other relevant sites - allows users to find what they need easily and will redirect them to where they need to go.
video displays - allows users to access MVs from the website without the need to go to youtube to find them

features left to implement:
slider to present more of the merchandise and MVs - allows users to see more of the merch available without going to the online store and to be able to watch all of the MVs in the site.
a page to expand on all existing news and live information - allows users to see old news as well as all future live events' information

feature ideas:
animated buttons - gives users a more interesting experience while navigating the site
a unique cursor for the website - gives users a more interesting experience while navigating the site

technologies used: 
I used HTML, CSS and Javascript to code the website. most of the references used for knowing how to code is by referencing W3School and Stack Overflow.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

navigation bar:
go to any page
try to press any of the buttons
verify that the buttons bring you to the correct section of the home screen

news/ live toggle:
go to the home page
try to press the news/live button
verify that the information changes when the different button is pressed

MV toggle:
go to the movie page
verify that video is loaded and information is correct
try to press a different mv button and verify that the correct information is changed
Bugs:
when pressing the different mv buttons, only the buttons opacity will change and not the information even though they are activated by the same action.

Sign Up and Login:
Go to the Sign Up page
try to submit the form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
try to submit the form with an invalid password and verify that a relevant error message appears
try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that the information is successfully stored in localstorage.
go to the login page
try to submit the form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
try to submit the form with an invalid passwor and verify that a relevant error message appears
try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verfiy that the correct prompt is issued
Bugs:
even while using an invalid username/email to login, the site will still prompt that login was successful.
